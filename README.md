# adventure-engine
A simple text-based dungeon crawler

## Hello World!
The goal of this project is to build a simple "game engine" that takes and reads in a simple text file and "buids" 
a dungeon crawler game from said text file.

## Behind the name...
The name comes from the IBM Game "Colossal cave adventure" sold as "Microsoft Adventure" for the IBM PC in 1981.

## TODO 
Classes for specific objects need to be made for the following:
Rooms
Creatures
Items

*Do I want to make a player class too? I'll figure that out later...
