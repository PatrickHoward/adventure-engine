# adventure-engine
A simple text-based dungeon crawler

## Hello World!
The goal of this project is to build a simple "game engine" that takes and reads in a simple text file and "builds" 
a dungeon crawler game from said text file.

## Behind the name...
The name comes from the IBM Game "Colossal cave adventure" sold as "Microsoft Adventure" for the IBM PC in 1981.
